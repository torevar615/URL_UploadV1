# Large File Download Options for Telegram Bots

## Current Limitation
Telegram Bot API has a 50MB limit for file uploads via bots.

## How Other Bots Handle Large Files (1.5GB+)

### Option 1: Cloud Storage Integration
**Most Common Approach**
- Download file to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
- Send user a download link instead of the file directly
- Examples: Google Drive API, Dropbox API, OneDrive API

### Option 2: File Splitting
- Split large files into 50MB chunks
- Send multiple files that user can rejoin
- Include instructions for reassembly

### Option 3: MTProto API (Advanced)
- Use Telegram's MTProto API instead of Bot API
- Requires more complex implementation
- Can handle files up to 2GB
- Libraries: Pyrogram, Telethon

### Option 4: External Download Services
- Upload to temporary file sharing services
- Send download link to user
- Services: WeTransfer, SendSpace, etc.

### Option 5: Local HTTP Server
- Bot runs local web server
- Provides direct download URL to user
- User downloads via web browser

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Cloud Storage** (Easiest to implement)
2. **File Splitting** (Good user experience)
3. **External Services** (Quick solution)
4. **MTProto API** (Most complex but most capable)

## Trade-offs

- **Bot API**: Simple, 50MB limit
- **Cloud Storage**: Requires API keys, great for large files
- **MTProto**: Complex setup, handles everything natively
- **File Splitting**: Works but inconvenient for users
