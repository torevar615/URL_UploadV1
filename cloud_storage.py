Your file "{filename}" has been split into {num_chunks} parts.

**Windows:**
```
copy /b "{name}.part001{ext}"+"{name}.part002{ext}"+... "{filename}"
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```
cat "{name}.part001{ext}" "{name}.part002{ext}" ... > "{filename}"
```

**Alternative:** Use file joining software like HJSplit, 7-Zip, or WinRAR.
